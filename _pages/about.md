You're coming to our wedding so you probably know quite a bit about us already!
We've been together for a long time (almost 9 years!) and never really thought we'd get married.
However, a wedding (or two) is a great way to get some of our friends and family in the same place.
We've lived together in two countries, neither of which is where we're from.
A lot of our friends are (recovering) academics, which means they're scattered all over the world.
Thank you all for celebrating with us, we really appreciate it.

## Our relationship, one picture a year
