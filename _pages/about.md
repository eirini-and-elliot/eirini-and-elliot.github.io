## About us

You're coming to our wedding so you probably know quite a bit about us already!

We've been together for a long time and never really thought we'd get married.
However, a wedding is a great way to get some of our friends and family in the same place, to celebrate our life together.
We've lived together in two countries, neither of which is where we're from and a lot of our friends are (recovering) academics, meaning they're scattered all over the world.

So thank you all for coalescing to celebrate with us, we really appreciate it.

### Our relationship, one picture a year 

{% include gallery caption="Summary: we like to travel and hang out with various creatures." %}

## About the venue

We're having the party at the Victorian Pumping Station of the [Cambridge Museum of Technology](https://www.museumoftechnology.com/), a slightly unusual venue for a wedding celebration but, oh well, we're not averse to *slightly unusual*.
It is a working museum on the industrial heritage of Cambridge and has a, we think, delightful steampunk vibe.

We have both spent many hours in the courtyard of this museum, at the various iterations of pizza places, looking at the river and watching the rowers go by, even before the sport took over Eirini's life.
[Kerb Collective](https://www.kerbkollective.coffee/) (the museum's cafe) is the provider of an untold number of cinnamon buns consumed by Eirini and her fellow rowers, which you will also get to experience.

In planning this wedding party, we came to realise just how much we love Cambridge.
We're so excited we get to share one of the places that is special to us with you all.

## About the food

Food and refreshments will be provided by some of our favourite places in Cambridge and we encourage you to give them a visit!

- Food: [Ellimatta](https://www.instagram.com/ellimatta.cambridge/?hl=en-gb). When writing this, Ellimatta had just turned one year old, which is wild as it feels like it's been there forever. Amanda and Shane have created a wonderful, welcoming space that's a slice of home away from home, especially for the Australian in this relationship. The food is incredible and the coffee is our favourite.
- Drinks: [Cambridge Wine Merchants](https://www.cambridgewine.com/?srsltid=AfmBOooX64TSIoHDeq6SRgvxg3iFean5T6ZNMluUyR0j314Nf027QjHq). We have spent more Sunday afternoons here getting drunk than we'd care to admit. They won us over even more by stocking Greek and Western Australian wines!
- Cinnamon buns: [Kerb Collective](https://www.kerbkollective.coffee/). All we'll say is that if Eirini were to get a tattoo of these cinnamon buns, she wouldn't be the first.
