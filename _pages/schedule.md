### Schedule

This'll be a casual affair, because hello have you met us??

We have booked the [Cambridge Museum of Technology](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FUrpX2WgPmRaSqw76) from 18:00. 
We encourage you to be there at 18:00, but if you need to come a bit later, it's not the end of the world!

Here is a rough itinerary:

+ 18:00 Arrive at the Cambridge Museum of Technology for drinks and milling around the pumps and gauges
+ 19:00 'Ceremony' with speeches from us and loved ones. No bureaucracy, that'll have happened in advance
+ 19:30 Buffet dinner and more drinks
+ 20:30 Pub quiz, because nerds
+ 23:00 Get outta here! (and keep drinking at another, secret location)

### Dress code
Vaguely nice.

**_Strictly no lycra._**

Cambridge is a wonderful place to live for many, many reasons.
Public transport is not one of them.
Depending on where you're staying, the easiest way to get to the venue is going to be walking, cycling, or taxi.
+ Cycling: you can hire a voi scooter or bicycle all over Cambridge. Some hotels also provide bicycles. We may also be able to borrow friends' spare bikes, so let us know if you need one!
+ Uber operates in Cambridge, in case you already have an account with them. Other local taxi companies are [Veezu](https://www.veezu.co.uk/cambridge) and [CamCab](https://camcab.co.uk/).

There are limited parking spaces at the venue, so let us know if you plan on driving.
