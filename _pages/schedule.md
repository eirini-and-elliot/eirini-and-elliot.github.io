### Schedule

This is going to be a casual affair, because hello have you met us??

We have booked the [Cambridge Museum of Technology](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FUrpX2WgPmRaSqw76) from 18:00 to 23:00. 
We encourage you to be there from 18:00.
If you need to come a bit later, it's not the end of the world!

Here is a rough schedule:

+ 18:00 Arrive at the Cambridge Museum of Technology for drinks and milling around the pumps and gauges
+ 19:00 'Ceremony' with speeches from us and loved ones. No bureaucracy here, that'll have happened in advance
+ 19:30 Buffet dinner and more drinks
+ 20:30 Pub quiz, because nerds
+ 23:00 Get outta here! (and keep drinking at another, secret location)

### Dress code
Vaguely nice! The colour theme is yellows and blues, so if you have something you love in these colours, feel free to wear it.

**_Strictly no lycra._**
