## Schedule

This'll be a casual affair, because hello have you met us??

We have booked the [Cambridge Museum of Technology](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FUrpX2WgPmRaSqw76) from 18:00. 
We encourage you to be there at 18:00, but if you need to come a bit later, it's not the end of the world!

Here is a rough itinerary:

+ 18:00 Arrive at the Cambridge Museum of Technology for drinks and milling around the pumps and gauges
+ 19:00 'Ceremony' with speeches from us and loved ones. No bureaucracy, that'll have happened in advance
+ 19:30 Buffet dinner and more drinks
+ 20:30 Pub quiz, because nerds
+ 23:00 Get outta here! (and keep drinking at another, secret location)

## Dress code
Cocktail attire-ish.
We don't particularly care about the length, patterns or colours of your dress/trousers/suit/jumpsuit.
Wear something nice that you feel comfortable in.

**_Rowers, strictly no lycra._**

## Address & Getting there
<address>
  Cambridge Museum of Technology<br /> Riverside, CB5 8LD<br /> United Kingdom
</address>

<br>
Cambridge is a wonderful place to live for many, many reasons.
Public transport is not one of them.
Depending on where you're staying, the easiest way to get to the venue is going to be walking, cycling, or taxi.
+ Cycling: you can hire a voi scooter or bicycle all over Cambridge. Some hotels also provide bicycles. We may also be able to borrow friends' spare bikes, so let us know if you need one!
+ Uber operates in Cambridge, in case you already have an account with them. Other local taxi companies are [Veezu](https://www.veezu.co.uk/cambridge) and [CamCab](https://camcab.co.uk/).

There are limited parking spaces at the venue, so let us know if you plan on driving.

## Presents

Please do not feel obliged to get us a present! A few of you are helping us out with the planning and running of this thing and others are travelling from literally the other side of the world. So we really mean it when we say you don't need to get us anything. We're just happy you're coming ‚ù§Ô∏è

If you do want to get us something, thank you, we really appreciate it! We don't really need stuff, as our flat is small and we already have everything we need, but here are some options for you:

+ Do something with us ‚ú® Help us out with something, or suggest something fun to do together some time.
+ Buy us books, which are categorically not stuff üìö We've made a wishlist at [Daunt Books](https://dauntbooks.co.uk/gift_lists/eirini-and-elliot-wedding-list/) you can choose from.
+ Help us pay for our honey moon üåã You can send us money with [this link](https://paymentrequest.natwestpayit.com/reusable-links/e0f6fb57-8dca-4c19-9c43-10f23951c272), but it'll only work if you have a UK account. If you do not and still want to send us money, get in touch.
