Here's some information for those of you coming from out of town (and overseas!).

### Getting to Cambridge

#### By train
There are Eurostar services from mainland Europe to St Pancras International.
Happily, there are trains both from St Pancras and from King's Cross (which is literally across the street) that go to Cambridge.
The Great Northern trains from King's Cross going to Ely or King's Lynn are the fastest at about 50'.

#### By plane
If you're flying in, by far the easiest airport to get to Cambridge from is **Stansted** via a 30' train.
If you land late at night, you may need to take cab, which would cost you about Â£60.

There are also direct trains from **Gatwick**, but those are significantly longer at about 2 hours.
They also don't run very late, so avoid it if you're getting in late.

_In any case, do check the train situation when booking flights as train reliability in the UK these days is... patchy._

### Accommodation
Unless you're coming with a larger group, hotels will likely be better value-for-money than Airbnbs.

In terms of locations, the wedding party is in the Chesterton area.
Although pretty, this isn't particularly close to the centre of Cambridge, so depending on how long you're staying and what you plan on doing, it may not be the best place to base yourselves.
A safe bet is the Cambridge train station area, which is a 20' walk from central Cambridge and a 10' walk from Mill Road, where you'll find nice restaurants, bars and cafes.

### Things to do in Cambridge
A non-hierarchical list of some of the things we enjoy doing in Cambridge:

- Go to any of the vendors we sourced food and drinks from (see [About](/about))
- Go to any of the [Uncomfortable Cambridge](https://www.uncomfortablecambridge.com/) walking tours. They are run by PhD students and cover the more, well, uncomfortable, aspects of Cambridge history, including its involvement in colonialism and Empire
- Walk to Grantchester Meadows and have tea and scones at [The Orchard](https://www.theorchardteagarden.co.uk/)
- Catch the [Evensong at King's College Chapel](https://www.kings.cam.ac.uk/chapel/attending-chapel-services)
- Go to the [Fitzwilliam Museum](https://www.museums.cam.ac.uk/museums/the-fitzwilliam-museum) (Eirini is especially fond of the still lives)
- Go to [Kettle's Yard](https://www.kettlesyard.cam.ac.uk/) (house and modern art gallery collection)
- See the intricate hand-painted interiors of the [David Parr House](https://davidparrhouse.org/) - a hidden gem!
